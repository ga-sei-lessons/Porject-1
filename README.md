# MVP
* A grid of cards with Pokemon images on them
* Clicking on a card would flip it over to reveal its hidden image
* Clicking on a second card would also flip it over, and if the two cards match, they would disappear from the grid
* If the two cards don't match, they would flip back over to their hidden state
* A button to start a new game
# Potential stretch goals
* Randomized card placement to keep the game fresh and prevent memorization
* Different themes or skins, such as different generations of Pokemon or different regions from the Pokemon world
